For PBE :
h3s.scf.fit.in -> h3s.scf.in -> h3s.elph.in -> lambda.in 

For LDA:
h3s.scf.fit.in -> h3s.scf.in -> h3s.elph.in -> (impose sum rule on dyn1) 
  -> set trans = .false. in h3s.elph.in -> h3s.elph.in -> make sure all the
  frequencies in elph.inp_lambda.1 are positive -> lambda.in

For OPTIMIZE:
1. Copy the following files in the OPTIMIZE directory:
   i. h3s.scf.in (change the path of the pseudo file)
   ii. It's corresponding h3s.scf.out
   iii. make a copy of the h3s.scf.in and rename it scf.in
   iv. in scf.in change 
       (a) add 'line0' to the 'prefix', like './Temp/h3s line0 
       (b) and change the atomic positions to 'lin1', 'line2' ...
   v. a copy of h3s.dyn1 (make sure sum rule is imposed) 

2. Line 76 of optimize.py has a string which is machine specific, make
   sure that's correct. If working on a super comp make sure you correctly
   specify the nojobs (global) in parameters.py and then rum the 'startup'
   script for the pbs files. Also in optimize.py make sure you specify the 
   working directory (only on a super comp). 

3. The following files must be in the root directory: 
   i. optimize.py (for doing optimization)
   ii. evaluate.py (file containing various functions)
   iii. readjob.py (for reading input files)
   iv. parameters.py (eneter free parameters here, specfically Nc) 
  
4. pwsf calculations will be performed over Nc number of files present 
   in InFiles directory and it's output files will be dumped into OutFiles. 
   The result of optimization will be printed to optimize.out file.
